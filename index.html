        This article explores how pulsars—rapidly rotating neutron stars discovered in 1967—can serve as some of the most precise natural clocks in the universe. Because their radio pulses arrive with remarkable regularity, pulsars offer scientists a unique way to measure time far beyond the accuracy of traditional astronomical methods. In this article, we will discuss what pulsars are, how their signals are detected, and why their stability makes them valuable for timekeeping. We will also examine how researchers create pulsar timing models, what factors can affect their precision, and how these models are used in fields such as astrophysics, gravitational-wave research, and future spacecraft navigation. Drawing from well-known scientific sources, including Pulsar Astronomy by Lyne & Graham-Smith and international pulsar timing array studies, this introduction sets the stage for understanding how these extraordinary stellar remnants could help shape the future of time measurement.
